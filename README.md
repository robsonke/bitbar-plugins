# bitbar-plugins
Created my own repository for Bitbar plugins as I've modified some existing ones to my own need and added some custom ones.

## create subfolder enabled
A subfolder enabled helps you quickly enabling / disabling plugins without deleting them. A simple symlink from the git repo does the trick: ln -s ../brew-updates.1h.sh .
